                          Not only is its inclusion compulsory, but it represents a flagship series of sports that has featured at all 17 editions.

                          It succeeded the athletics events that were held within the Far Eastern Championship Games, considered to be a precursor to the Asian Games, which were held from 1913 to 1934.

                          China lead the all-time medal table with 300 gold, 197 silver and 109 bronze.</p>

                          Badminton is a racquet sport played using racquets to hit a shuttlecock across a net. Although it may be played with larger teams, the most common forms of the game are "singles" (with one player per side) and "doubles" (with two players per side). Badminton is often played as a casual outdoor activity in a yard or on a beach; formal games are played on a rectangular indoor court. Points are scored by striking the shuttlecock with the racquet and landing it within the opposing side's half of the court.
                          <br/>
                          Badminton was incorporated into the Asian Games in 1962.
                          It has since been ever-present on the sport programme.
                          China lead the all-time medal table with 40 gold, 28 silver and 33 bronze.

                          Boxing is a combat sport in which two people, usually wearing protective gloves, throw punches at each other for a predetermined amount of time in a boxing ring.<br/>

                          The result is decided when an opponent is deemed incapable to continue by a referee, is disqualified for breaking a rule, or resigns by throwing in a towel. If a fight completes all of its allocated rounds, the victor is determined by judges' scorecards at the end of the contest. In the event that both fighters gain equal scores from the judges, professional bouts are considered a draw. In Olympic boxing, because a winner must be declared, judges award the content to one fighter on technical criteria.

                          Boxing was incorporated into the Asian Games in 1954.
                          It has since been ever-present on the sport programme.

                          Kabaddi is a contact team sport. Played between two teams of seven players, the object of the game is for a single player on offence, referred to as a "raider", to run into the opposing team's half of a court, tag out as many of their defenders as possible, and return to their own half of the court, all without being tackled by the defenders, and in a single breath. Points are scored for each player tagged by the raider, while the opposing team earns a point for stopping the raider. Players are taken out of the game if they are tagged or tackled, but can be "revived" for each point scored by their team from a tag or tackle.</br>

                          Kabaddi made its first appearance as an exhibition sport at the 1982 and became an Asian Games event since 1990 in Beijing, China. Until the 2014 edition, India always dominated the event by winning highest number of gold medals in both men's and women's category.

                          Football is a family of team sports that involve, to varying degrees, kicking a ball to score a goal. Unqualified, the word football is understood to refer to whichever form of football is the most popular in the regional context in which the word appears. Sports commonly called football in certain places include association football (known as soccer in some countries); gridiron football (specifically American football or Canadian football); Australian rules football; rugby football (either rugby league or rugby union); and Gaelic football.[1][2] These different variations of football are known as football codes.<br/>
                          Men's football has been a part of the Asian Games sporting events since the 1951 edition. Women's football competition began in 1990.

                          Cycling, also called bicycling or biking, is the use of bicycles for transport, recreation, exercise or sport. People engaged in cycling are referred to as "cyclists", "bikers", or less commonly, as "bicyclists". Apart from two-wheeled bicycles, "cycling" also includes the riding of unicycles, tricycles, quadracycles, recumbent and similar human-powered vehicles (HPVs).

                          Bicycles were introduced in the 19th century and now number approximately one billion worldwide. They are the principal means of transportation in many parts of the world.

                          Cycling is widely regarded as a very effective and efficient mode of transportation optimal for short to moderate distances.

                          Bicycles provide numerous benefits in comparison with motor vehicles, including the sustained physical exercise involved in cycling, easier parking, increased maneuverability, and access to roads, bike paths and rural trails. Cycling also offers a reduced consumption of fossil fuels, less air or noise pollution, and much reduced traffic congestion. These lead to less financial cost to the user as well as to society at large (negligible damage to roads, less road area required). By fitting bicycle racks on the front of buses, transit agencies can significantly increase the areas they can serve.

                          Cycling was incorporated into the Asian Games in 1951. 
                          It has since featured at every edition with the exception of 1954. 
                          Japan lead the all-time medal table with 52 gold, 52 silver and 25 bronze.
